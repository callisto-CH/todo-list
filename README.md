# todo-list

This Todo List project was created for The Odin Project.

I definitely took a few key lessons away from this project:

Break down problems into smaller problems, and those problems into smaller ones. For instance, questions that I asked while making this app included: What functionality should my app have? What's a generalized list of things a user should be able to do with my app (i.e. make a list, make a todo, etc)? For each of those things, how should the data and UI be changed, step by step, to achieve the result? How should I be storing the data? I floundered with this project at first, jumping between different bits of functionality I was working on... I felt overwhelmed at one point and realized I just needed to focus on one thing at a time. Take one problem and make that my focus until it is solved, then move on to the next. Once every piece is working correctly, it was a matter of testing and ironing out some bugs that arose so that each piece of functionality could work in tandem. This approach also showed me the value of breaking my code up into smaller pieces to make referencing my code more convenient.

Also, by taking a user-centric approach to my problem-solving, I learned the value of keeping track of what the user is currently doing. In this project, the state module records the list that the user is currently working in, as well as what todo they are currently editing. This makes internally altering and recording data simple.

Oh yes......... and I really need to get used to committing at each step of the way!!!

There is definitely room for improvement, I feel, in my application of the SOLID principles that the Odin Project covered... and this is definitely a project I want to revisit in the future to clean up. But I will let my first version of it remain.

If you find any bugs though please let me know. Just don't go messing around with localStorage in the console and expecting everything to be fine.
